<b>The Immortals of Meluha by Amish Tripathi is the first book of the Shiva Trilogy. It surrounds the deeds and adventures of Shiva, a Tibetan Chief immigrated to the supposedly perfect society of Meluha built by Lord Ram. When he arrives to this near magical place, he becomes the center of an age old prophecy. This prophecy in states that a man with a blue throat will save them from their violent enemies, the Chandravanshis and the Nagas. Shiva is now placed under heavy responsibility and unbridled respect as he goes on to become the leader of a grand-scale war that he doesn’t know anything about.</b><br><br><hr>

<small>Growing up listening to many stories surrounding Hinduism and Indian culture, it gave me motivation as an adult to look for novels such as this. A telling of grand heroes, powerful female characters, unrelenting use of magic and the constant message or lesson embedded in each tale. The Immortals of Meluha holds itself to this standard. Shiva goes through his journey learning of what it means to have the ‘perfect’ society. Along with the risks and tribulations involved in making the world a better place even though things seem fine on the surface.</small><br><br>

<i>Most of the story follows Shiva and his constant curiosity of the new world around him. Shiva quickly became one of my favourite written male characters purely because of his dynamic energy. He encapsulates a rough-hewn man who smokes and fights harder than most soldiers. At the same time, he’s graceful and creative. It’s rare to see a male character who swings a sword like a seasoned warrior and dances like an angel in the same story.</i><br>

<del>Vikarma is essentially a mark of shame placed on people who’ve suffered disabilities or women who’ve suffered miscarriages. They believe that these ailments are caused by a sin committed in a past life.</del><br><br>

<mark>Another character I loved is the main female lead, Princess Sati of Meluha. She’s patient and strong willed, a little rigid and a powerful fighter. I loved that Sati still stood proud in her femininity while being a tough fighter, it made her layered and interesting. Despite this talent, Sati was forced in a shunned group called the vikarma due to a miscarriage in a past marriage.</mark><br><br>

<ins>oing back to the chosen one narrative, my favourite part of this book was the sheer awareness of it all. Shiva and even other side characters question the idea of placing so much trust on someone who had just immigrated to their city. We have the King who’s desperate to have a hero in their midst, giving Shiva the utmost respect. Then you also have a Commander who gives Shiva a hard time because he believes that respect needs to be earned. At the same time, Shiva is in the center struggling to help people when he doesn’t know how to do it. The way this narrative was broken down into pieces and turned into genuine character struggles so that Shiva could earn the respect of these people was so enjoyable to read.</ins><br><br>
